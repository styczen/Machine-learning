# %% ==================== Part 1: Email Preprocessing ====================
#  To use an SVM to classify emails into Spam v.s. Non-Spam, you first need
#  to convert each email into a vector of features. In this part, you will
#  implement the preprocessing steps for each email. You should
#  complete the code in process_email.py to produce a word indices vector
#  for a given email.

# %% ==================== Part 2: Feature Extraction ====================
#  Now, you will convert each email into a vector of features in R^n. 
#  You should complete the code in email_features.py to produce a feature
#  vector for a given email.

# %% =========== Part 3: Train Linear SVM for Spam Classification ========
#  In this section, you will train a linear classifier to determine if an
#  email is Spam or Not-Spam.

# Load the Spam Email dataset
# You will have X, y in your environment

# %% =================== Part 4: Test Spam Classification ================
#  After training the classifier, we can evaluate it on a test set.

# Load the test dataset ('data/spamTest_X.csv', 'data/spamTest_y.csv').
# You will have Xtest, ytest in your environment

# %% ================= Part 5: Top Predictors of Spam ====================
#  Since the model we are training is a linear SVM, we can inspect the
#  weights learned by the model to understand better how it is determining
#  whether an email is spam or not. The following code finds the words with
#  the highest weights in the classifier. Informally, the classifier
#  'thinks' that these words are the most likely indicators of spam.

# Print the list of 15 most prominent features.
# (i.e. words which gives strongest evidence for an email being a spam)
# - Obtain the weights of the SVC model.
# - Obtain the indices that would sort the weights in the descending order.
# - Obtain the vocabulary.

weights = clf.coef_
weights_sorted = np.sort(weights[0])
weights_sorted = np.flip(weights_sorted)

    # Replace each `None` with an appropriate expression.

        word=vocabulary_dict[i], weight=weights_sorted[i]))

print('\n\n')
# input('\nProgram paused. Press enter to continue.\n')

# %% =================== Part 6: Try Your Own Emails =====================
#  Now that you've trained the spam classifier, you can use it on your own
#  emails! In the starter code, we have included spamSample1.txt,
#  spamSample2.txt, emailSample1.txt and emailSample2.txt as examples. 
#  The following code reads in one of these emails and then uses your 
#  learned SVM classifier to determine whether the email is Spam or 
#  Not Spam

# Set the file to be read in (change this to spamSample2.txt,
# emailSample1.txt or emailSample2.txt to see different predictions on
# different emails types). Try your own emails as well!

             'data/spamSample2.txt', 'data/emailSample2.txt']

    # Read and predict
    file_contents = read_file(filename)
    word_indices = process_email(file_contents, False)
    x = email_features(word_indices)
    # Predict the labelling.
    y_pred = clf.predict(x)
    
    print('\nProcessed {}\n\nSpam Classification: {}\n'.format(filename, y_pred[0] > 0))
    print('(1 indicates spam, 0 indicates not spam)\n\n')
